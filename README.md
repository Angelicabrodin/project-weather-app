Project 6, build a Weather-App, made during my Technigo Bootcamp 2019!

## 1. What is this?
This is a weather-app that uses javascript to fetch an open API to show in real-time todays weather and a 5 day forecast. 

## 2. What did I do?

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app/dashboard that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. I have used a public API to fetch external data to my websites. This is also the first time that we are starting to understand more about basic JSON, and how to use promises in Javascript. If I would have more time, I would have tried to change into my own picked icons when the weather is changing, there could also be alot made on the styling and responsiveness, even though it now works on all 3 units. 


## 3. Where can you see it in action?
